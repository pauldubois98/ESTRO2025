# Evaluation of transformer architecture for deep dose prediction in radiotherapy

## Introduction

Radiotherapy treatment planning seeks to maximize tumor control while sparing healthy tissue. Traditionally, treatment plans are developed through iterative, manual processes involving dose constraints. With advances in deep learning, automated dose prediction based on patient scans has gained traction, typically using architectures like 3D Unets. However, transformers, initially popularized in natural language processing, have recently demonstrated robust performance on image and audio data, suggesting potential for application in medical imaging. This study investigates replacing the conventional 3D Unet with a 3D transformer-based architecture for dose prediction, assessing performance and training efficiency.
